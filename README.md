# Visual Studio Code workspace for PDF document generation from Markdown files

Includes customizations in order to simplify document generation for TSG

Currently automatic PDF generation on save is disabled (see [workspace configuration](Tsg-doc.code-workspace))

In order to generate the PDF (or HTML) document, "Markdown PDF" extension is required (currently set as recommended on the workspace).

When automatic generation is disabled, to generate the document open the command palette *(CTRL+P)* and select `Markdown PDF: Export (PDF)`
